"""Stage 2 of resolving aliases in the subject dictionary: merging two existing subjects (2026-10-03, user 'a').

A declared alias that already names another subject leaves an alias_conflict question. Only the user's answer merges:
same -> the two subjects become one (fragment/leaf subject_id moved in place, no revision bump: option A, user); different
-> the question closes, nothing changes; defer -> nothing. Every moved row is logged (subject_merge_item, with a guard of
the row as merged) so an undo reverts exactly those rows. Lock order (astra merge r1 P1-4): the host dictionary lock
first -- digestion and backfill take it exclusive at transaction start, merge/undo exclusive, scans and listings shared --
then rows. Merge/undo bump the host's subject generation (a judgement made before it is not stored after it) and queue
the affected fragments for a rescan. Design: .local/merge-design.md + astra design and code reviews.
