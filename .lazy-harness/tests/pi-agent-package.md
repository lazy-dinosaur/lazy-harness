# Pi / OMP Agent Package Regression

Status: active
Layer: TDD

## Rule digest

- Status: active
- Layer: TDD
- Scope: framework-global
- Applies when:
  - working on the in-repo Pi/OMP agent package install or wrapper UX
  - bridging agent extension events to lazy-harness lifecycle hooks or changing reminder/mutation-guard behavior
- Must:
  - keep separate `lazy pi` and `lazy omp` wrapper command arrays plus explicit `package.json#omp` resources
  - bridge `before_agent_start`/`tool_call`/`tool_result`/`agent_end` to canonical hooks (incl. `agent_end` → `on-response-completed.sh` post-turn audit driven as a bounded continuation: `pi.sendUserMessage(body, { deliverAs: "followUp" })`, loop-capped by `MAX_ADVISORY_CONTINUATIONS`, falling back to non-steering display); preserve OMP string-array `systemPrompt` blocks
  - re-scope hook root, recent-tool evidence, and `/lazy-*` execution to live session cwd after `/move`
  - carry the interactive grammar (record↔code conflict→ask, option gate, requirements-first) in the `before_agent_start` reminder and re-inject it via the `context` event after file-touching tool results (jcode mid-turn re-grounding parity)
  - project the jcode-shape `agent_end` payload (`assistant_response` + `last_user_message` from `event.messages`, string `args_preview` per `recent_tool_calls` entry) so `on-response-completed.sh` helper satisfaction works under Pi/OMP and does not loop
- Must not:
  - invent a second policy engine or let OMP silently fall back to Pi-only packaging
- Record completion:
  - changes to package wrappers, extension bridge, or activation prompts update this TDD plus its SDD/ADR

## Regression target

The in-repo Pi/OMP package must remain installable through separate Pi and OMP wrapper UX and must bridge agent extension events to canonical lazy-harness lifecycle hooks without inventing a second policy engine.

## Protected fixtures

| Case | Trigger | Expected |
|---|---|---|
| `pi_omp_package_manifest_resources` | Parse `packages/lazy-harness-pi/package.json` | Manifest name is `@lazy-dinosaur/lazy-harness-pi`; keywords include `pi-package` and `omp-plugin`; both `pi.*` and `omp.*` resource sections point to package-local extensions, skills, and prompts |
| `pi_clean_default_no_project_settings` | Inspect source checkout | `.pi/settings.json` is absent by default after factory reset; project-local Pi attachment is generated only by an intentional install command |
| `pi_install_guidance` | Inspect package README and SDD | Global bootstrap and project-local activation commands are documented, including that the package is not installed by default after a clean reset |
| `cross_platform_dependency_guidance` | Inspect installer, README, package README, and SDD | macOS/Linux prerequisites are documented; installer requires `git`, `bun`, and `python3` before mutation and prints OS-specific install hints |
| `lazy_pi_wrapper_guidance` | Inspect package README, SDD, `.lazy-harness/bin/lazy`, and `.lazy-harness/scripts/pi-package.ts` | `lazy pi install/list/remove/smoke/doctor` is documented and dispatched; install defaults to global bootstrap; remove requires explicit scope; dry-run is supported |
| `lazy_pi_wrapper_dry_run` | Run `pi-package.ts` dry-run fixtures | Default/global install, explicit local install, local remove, and one-run smoke dry-run produce the exact Pi command arrays without mutating settings |
| `lazy_pi_wrapper_doctor_no_smoke` | Run `pi-package.ts doctor --no-smoke --format=json` | Doctor is safe in environments without persistent Pi package settings and reports that smoke is skipped/non-mutating |
| `lazy_omp_wrapper_guidance` | Inspect package README, SDD, `.lazy-harness/bin/lazy`, and `.lazy-harness/scripts/pi-package.ts` | `lazy omp install/list/remove/smoke/doctor` is documented and dispatched separately from `lazy pi` |
| `lazy_omp_wrapper_dry_run` | Run `pi-package.ts` with `LAZY_AGENT_RUNTIME=omp` and lazy CLI OMP dispatch fixtures | OMP install/remove/smoke dry-runs produce exact `omp plugin install`, `omp plugin uninstall`, and `omp -e` command arrays without mutating plugin settings |
| `lazy_omp_wrapper_doctor_no_smoke` | Run OMP doctor no-smoke in non-strict mode | Doctor is safe in environments without persistent OMP plugin settings and reports that smoke is skipped/non-mutating |
| `lazy_pi_source_target_isolation` | Run `lazy pi install --local --dry-run` and direct `pi-package.ts` from another cwd with stale parent `LAZY_INVOCATION_CWD`, plus explicit `--target-repo` | Source package path stays in the lazy-harness source checkout while target repo resolves to caller/explicit repo; direct wrapper ignores stale parent invocation cwd unless `LAZY_PI_TARGET_REPO` or `--target-repo` is set |
| `lazy_pi_global_bootstrap_no_harness_noop` | Fake runtime calls `before_agent_start` from a temp directory without `.lazy-harness/bin/lazy` | The globally loaded extension returns `undefined` and injects no lazy-harness reminder |
| `lazy_agent_activation_prompts` | Run `lazy agent activate` against a temp initialized git repo | `.pi/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` and `.omp/APPEND_SYSTEM.md` contain managed pointer prompts, and `.git/info/exclude` contains `.pi/` and `.omp/` |
| `lazy_pi_local_settings_git_exclude` | Inspect `.pi/settings.json` and target repo exclude behavior | Generated `.pi/settings.json` is allowed only when untracked and `.pi/` is present in `.git/info/exclude`; local install dry-run reports the exclude path |
| `pi_extension_before_agent_start_bridge` | Inspect extension source | Source contains `before_agent_start`, calls `on-message-received.sh`, and injects `REMINDER. Harness-first search/read debt before response.` fallback |
| `omp_before_agent_start_system_prompt_array` | Fake OMP runtime calls `before_agent_start` with `systemPrompt: string[]` | The original prompt block remains an array element and the lazy reminder is appended as a new block, not comma-joined into one string |
| `pi_extension_tool_call_bridge` | Inspect extension source | Source contains `tool_call`, calls `on-tool-execute-before.sh`, and returns `{ block: true, reason }` only when hook output supplies a reason |
| `pi_extension_shell_alias_guard` | Fake Pi runtime calls `tool_call` with `cmd`, `terminal`, `bash`, and `batch` shell actions after `before_agent_start` | All action shell variants block until root-bound read/search evidence exists |
| `pi_extension_tool_result_evidence` | Inspect extension source | Source contains `tool_result` and records recent tool calls for evidence guard payloads |
| `pi_extension_root_scoped_recent_tools` | Fake Pi runtime touches repo A and repo B in one process | Repo B does not see repo A's `recent_tool_calls`; repo A retains its own recent tool evidence |
| `pi_extension_move_rescopes_root_state` | Fake OMP/Pi runtime keeps stale `ctx.cwd` but changes `ctx.sessionManager.getCwd()` after `/move` | Hook payloads, `LAZY_HOST_ROOT`, recent tool evidence, and `/lazy-*` command execution re-scope to the live session cwd |
| `pi_extension_agent_end_bounded_continuation` | Inspect extension source | `agent_end` drives any advisory inject body as a continuation via `sendUserMessage(body, { deliverAs: "followUp" })` (a bare `sendUserMessage` at turn-end throws `Agent is already processing`, so `followUp` queues it after the current turn); the same unresolved advisory is capped at `MAX_ADVISORY_CONTINUATIONS` turns, then falls back to non-steering `sendMessage({ display: true })`, and an empty body resets the per-root counter |
| `pi_extension_reminder_carries_interactive_grammar` | Fake runtime calls `before_agent_start` in a harness root | Reminder body includes the interactive grammar (record↔code conflict / option gate / requirements-first), not only the search/read-debt protocol |
| `pi_extension_context_regrounds_after_file_op` | Fake runtime fires `tool_result` for a `read`/`write`, then calls the `context` handler | `context` returns `{ messages }` with an appended `<system-reminder>` re-grounding message sourced from `on-context.sh` |
| `pi_extension_context_noop_without_file_op` | Fake runtime fires `context` with no preceding file-touching tool result | `context` returns `undefined` (no injection) |
| `pi_extension_agent_end_jcode_shape_payload` | Fake runtime fires `tool_result` (write to `.lazy-harness/knowledge/candidates.jsonl`) then `agent_end` with `event.messages` (user + assistant), capturing the payload via a fake `on-response-completed.sh` | Captured payload carries `assistant_response` (assistant prose), `last_user_message`, and a `recent_tool_calls[].args_preview` containing the written path |
| `pi_package_skills` | Inspect package skills | `lazy-init`, `lazy-doctor`, `lazy-sync`, `lazy-update`, and `lazy-test` expose `SKILL.md` wrappers |

## Automated coverage

Implemented by:

```text
.lazy-harness/scripts/self-test.py#check_pi_package_layout_and_contract
```

This check is `FRAMEWORK_ONLY` because `packages/lazy-harness-pi` is source-repo package code, not currently a Category A downstream mirror artifact.

## Manual/current-host smoke

## Layer completeness

- SDD: `.lazy-harness/spec/platform/pi-agent-package.md`
- BDD: Pi behavior mirrors `.lazy-harness/behavior/llm-owned-record-retrieval.md` for reminder and mutation guard behavior.
- SSOT: `.lazy-harness/decisions/0043-pi-native-package-in-source-repo.md` is the placement decision for now.
- ADR: `.lazy-harness/decisions/0043-pi-native-package-in-source-repo.md`, `.lazy-harness/decisions/0047-pi-omp-shared-package-separate-install-ux.md`
- DDD: no domain/business term impact.

## Rule placement

- Rule: Pi package regression coverage must include OMP `before_agent_start` string-array `systemPrompt` compatibility so reminder injection does not collapse prompt blocks.
- Scope: framework-global
- Primary record: `.lazy-harness/tests/pi-agent-package.md`
- Why not AGENTS.md: this is adapter regression coverage, not global prompt grammar.
- Why not `.jcode`: this protects shared Pi/OMP package behavior, not private Jcode wiring.
- Confirmation: inferred-from-runtime-evidence

## Rule placement

- Rule: Regression coverage must protect separate `lazy pi` and `lazy omp` wrapper command arrays plus explicit `package.json#omp`, so OMP does not silently fall back to Pi-only packaging.

- Primary record: `.lazy-harness/tests/pi-agent-package.md`
- Why not AGENTS.md: this is package installer regression coverage, not global prompt grammar.
- Why not `.jcode`: this protects shared Pi/OMP package behavior, not private Jcode wiring.
- Confirmation: user-confirmed

## Rule placement

- Rule: Pi/OMP package regression coverage must protect runtime `/move` re-scope so stale `ctx.cwd` cannot leak hook root, recent tool evidence, or `/lazy-*` command execution across projects.
